# Google Gemini API Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Google Gemini API into the ChatAI application, providing both text generation (Gemini Pro) and image generation (Gemini Pro Vision) capabilities with streaming responses, proper error handling, and rate limiting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Gemini Pro Text Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send text messages and receive AI-generated responses from Google Gemini Pro so that I can have intelligent conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a text message THEN the system SHALL use Gemini Pro API to generate a response
2. WHEN the AI is generating a response THEN I SHALL see a streaming/typing indicator
3. WHEN the response is ready THEN it SHALL appear in the chat with proper formatting
4. WHEN the API call fails THEN I SHALL see a user-friendly error message
5. WHEN I send multiple messages quickly THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
6. WHEN the response is long THEN it SHALL stream in real-time for better user experience

### Requirement 2: Gemini Pro Vision Image Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request image generation and receive AI-generated images from Gemini Pro Vision so that I can create visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request image generation THEN the system SHALL use Gemini Pro Vision API
2. WHEN I provide an image description THEN the system SHALL generate a relevant image
3. WHEN the image is being generated THEN I SHALL see a loading indicator
4. WHEN the image is ready THEN it SHALL display in the chat interface
5. WHEN image generation fails THEN I SHALL see an appropriate error message
6. WHEN I request multiple images THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting

### Requirement 3: API Key Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure API key management so that the Gemini API credentials are protected and properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load the Gemini API key from environment variables
2. WHEN the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL show a configuration error
3. WHEN the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the API key SHALL be securely transmitted
5. WHEN in development THEN the API key SHALL be loaded from .env.local
6. WHEN in production THEN the API key SHALL be loaded from secure environment variables

### Requirement 4: Rate Limiting and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle API limitations gracefully so that I have a smooth experience even when limits are reached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL show a "please wait" message
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest trying later
5. WHEN quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL show quota information
6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5: Streaming Responses

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see AI responses appear in real-time so that the chat feels natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates text THEN it SHALL stream word by word or chunk by chunk
2. WHEN streaming is active THEN I SHALL see a typing indicator
3. WHEN streaming completes THEN the final message SHALL be properly formatted
4. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to non-streaming response
5. WHEN I send a new message while streaming THEN the current stream SHALL be cancelled
6. WHEN streaming is slow THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 6: tRPC Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Gemini API calls to be integrated with tRPC so that they follow the same patterns as other API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making Gemini API calls THEN they SHALL use tRPC procedures
2. WHEN streaming responses THEN they SHALL use tRPC subscriptions or streaming
3. WHEN handling errors THEN they SHALL use tRPC error handling patterns
4. WHEN caching responses THEN they SHALL use tRPC caching mechanisms
5. WHEN type-checking THEN all Gemini API calls SHALL be fully typed
6. WHEN testing THEN Gemini procedures SHALL be testable through tRPC

### Requirement 7: Chat Interface Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want Gemini responses to appear seamlessly in the existing chat interface so that the experience is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I receive a text response THEN it SHALL appear as an AI message in the chat
2. WHEN I receive an image THEN it SHALL display properly in the chat interface
3. WHEN responses are streaming THEN they SHALL update the chat in real-time
4. WHEN I switch between text and image modes THEN the interface SHALL adapt accordingly
5. WHEN I scroll through chat history THEN Gemini responses SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN I copy responses THEN the text SHALL be properly formatted

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy configuration setup so that the Gemini integration can be quickly deployed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN I SHALL have clear instructions for API key setup
2. WHEN configuring rate limits THEN I SHALL be able to adjust them via environment variables
3. WHEN enabling/disabling features THEN I SHALL use feature flags
4. WHEN debugging THEN I SHALL have access to detailed logging
5. WHEN monitoring THEN I SHALL have access to usage metrics
6. WHEN updating API versions THEN the configuration SHALL be easily updatable
