# Auth0 Authentication Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Auth0 authentication service into the ChatAI application, replacing the current mock authentication system. Users will be able to sign up and sign in using email/password or Google OAuth, with a polished UI that fixes current icon positioning issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Auth0 Integration Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Auth0 authentication service so that users can have secure, production-ready authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Auth0 SDK SHALL be properly configured with environment variables
2. WHEN Auth0 is configured THEN the application SHALL connect to the correct Auth0 domain and client ID
3. WHEN Auth0 provider is set up THEN it SHALL wrap the entire application for authentication state management
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the application SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2: Email/Password Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up and sign in with my email and password so that I can access the ChatAI application securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Sign Up" THEN I SHALL see a form with name, email, and password fields
2. WHEN I submit valid sign-up information THEN my account SHALL be created in Auth0
3. WHEN I click "Sign In" THEN I SHALL see a form with email and password fields
4. WHEN I submit valid sign-in credentials THEN I SHALL be authenticated and redirected to the chat interface
5. WHEN I submit invalid credentials THEN I SHALL see appropriate error messages
6. WHEN I sign up successfully THEN I SHALL be automatically signed in
7. WHEN authentication fails THEN the error message SHALL be user-friendly and actionable

### Requirement 3: Google OAuth Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account so that I can quickly access the application without creating a new password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I see the sign-up form THEN I SHALL see a "Continue with Google" button
2. WHEN I see the sign-in form THEN I SHALL see a "Continue with Google" button
3. WHEN I click "Continue with Google" THEN I SHALL be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
4. WHEN I authorize the application with Google THEN I SHALL be redirected back and automatically signed in
5. WHEN Google OAuth fails THEN I SHALL see an appropriate error message
6. WHEN I sign in with Google for the first time THEN my account SHALL be created automatically
7. WHEN I sign in with Google THEN my profile information SHALL be populated from Google

### Requirement 4: UI/UX Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want a polished authentication interface with properly positioned icons and intuitive design so that the sign-up/sign-in experience is pleasant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I see input fields THEN the icons SHALL be properly positioned and not overlap with text
2. WHEN I type in input fields THEN the text SHALL not overlap with icons
3. WHEN I see the Google sign-in button THEN it SHALL have the official Google branding and styling
4. WHEN I interact with form elements THEN they SHALL have proper focus states and visual feedback
5. WHEN I see error messages THEN they SHALL be clearly visible and well-positioned
6. WHEN I use the forms on mobile THEN all elements SHALL be properly sized and accessible
7. WHEN I switch between sign-in and sign-up modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth

### Requirement 5: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions so that I don't have to sign in every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I sign in successfully THEN my authentication state SHALL persist across browser sessions
2. WHEN I close and reopen the browser THEN I SHALL remain signed in (if I chose to stay signed in)
3. WHEN I sign out THEN my authentication state SHALL be cleared completely
4. WHEN my session expires THEN I SHALL be prompted to sign in again
5. WHEN I'm authenticated THEN I SHALL see my profile information in the header
6. WHEN I'm not authenticated THEN I SHALL see the landing page

### Requirement 6: User Profile Integration

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my profile information to be displayed in the application so that I can see my account details and manage my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm signed in THEN my name SHALL be displayed in the header
2. WHEN I'm signed in THEN my profile picture SHALL be displayed (from Google or Auth0 default)
3. WHEN I click on my profile THEN I SHALL see options to view profile details and sign out
4. WHEN I sign out THEN I SHALL be redirected to the landing page
5. WHEN I view my profile THEN I SHALL see my email, name, and authentication method
6. WHEN my profile information changes THEN it SHALL be updated in the UI

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during authentication processes so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN I SHALL see loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN I SHALL see specific error messages
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN I SHALL see appropriate retry options
4. WHEN Auth0 service is unavailable THEN I SHALL see a service status message
5. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the error messages SHALL be helpful and actionable
6. WHEN loading states are active THEN form buttons SHALL be disabled to prevent double submission

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication data to be handled securely so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate THEN my credentials SHALL be handled securely by Auth0
2. WHEN I use Google OAuth THEN only necessary permissions SHALL be requested
3. WHEN authentication tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be stored securely
4. WHEN I sign out THEN all authentication tokens SHALL be cleared
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN sensitive information SHALL not be exposed in error messages
6. WHEN using the application THEN all authentication communications SHALL use HTTPS
