# ðŸ”§ Auth0 Callback Configuration Fix

## Issue Identified
Auth0 is working but the callback URL is not properly configured. The authentication flow is happening but getting stuck on redirect.

## Required Auth0 Dashboard Changes

### 1. Update Callback URLs
Go to your Auth0 Dashboard â†’ Applications â†’ Your App â†’ Settings

**Update these fields:**

**Allowed Callback URLs:**
```
http://localhost:3000/callback
```

**Allowed Logout URLs:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Allowed Web Origins:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Allowed Origins (CORS):**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Save Changes
Click "Save Changes" at the bottom of the settings page.

### 3. Test Authentication
1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Try "Continue with Google" - should work now
3. Try email/password sign up/sign in - should redirect to Auth0 Universal Login

## What Was Fixed
- âœ… Updated redirect URI to `/callback` endpoint
- âœ… Added proper scope configuration
- âœ… Improved callback handling
- âœ… Added debug logging

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Google OAuth**: Click â†’ Google consent â†’ Redirect to app (logged in)
2. **Email/Password**: Click â†’ Auth0 login page â†’ Enter credentials â†’ Redirect to app (logged in)

The authentication flow should now complete properly without getting stuck!
